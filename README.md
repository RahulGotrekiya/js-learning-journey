# 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey

A collection of interactive projects built while learning JavaScript fundamentals. Each project demonstrates core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and modern JavaScript features.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey through JavaScript fundamentals via hands-on projects from **"The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!"** by Jonas Schmedtmann. Each project is built following the course curriculum and reinforces specific concepts while building upon previous knowledge.

**Note:** These projects are learning exercises completed as part of the course. All project concepts and implementations are based on the course material by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Vanilla JavaScript** - Pure JS without frameworks
* **HTML5** - Semantic markup
* **CSS3** - Modern styling and responsive design
* **DOM API** - Direct browser interaction

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RahulGotrekiya/js-learning-journey.git
   cd js-learning-journey
   ```

2. **Open any project:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to a project folder
   cd 01-Guess-My-Number

   # Open in your browser
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Or use a local server:**

   ```bash
   # Using Node.js live-server (if installed)
   npx live-server
   ```

## 📚 Learning Source

This repository contains projects completed while following:

**🎓 Course:** "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!" <br>
**👨‍🏫 Instructor:** Jonas Schmedtmann <br>
**🌐 Platform:** Udemy <br>

All projects are built following the course curriculum and serve as practical implementations of the concepts taught. This is a learning repository where I practice and apply JavaScript fundamentals through guided projects.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

Each project targets specific JavaScript concepts taught in the course:

* **DOM Manipulation** - Selecting, modifying, and creating elements
* **Event Handling** - User interactions and browser events
* **Game Logic** - Implementing rules and win conditions
* **State Management** - Tracking and updating application state
* **Function Concepts** - Scope, closures, and higher-order functions
* **Modern JS Features** - ES6+ syntax and best practices

## 🎮 How to Play the Games

### Guess My Number

* Try to guess the secret number between 1 and 20
* You start with a score of 20
* Each wrong guess reduces your score
* Beat your high score!

### Pig Game

* Roll dice to accumulate points
* "Hold" to save your score and pass the turn
* But be careful - rolling a 1 loses all current points!
* First to 100 wins!
